				<h1>Illustrator</h1>
					
				<p>Since this was my first time using Illustrator and working with vector graphics it was a huge learning curve for me. For this project I was heavily inspired by the character designs in the game Hollow Knight. There were a lot of kinks I had to work out during the process of creating this character in Illustrator, but it was fun nonetheless.</p>
